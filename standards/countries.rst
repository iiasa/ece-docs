.. _countries:

A common list of country names
==============================

Having a standardized list of country names is an important prerequisite for region
definitions, scenario analysis and model comparison.

The :py:mod:`nomenclature` package (`read the docs`_) builds on the :py:mod:`pycountry`
package to provide a standardized list of country names based on the
`ISO 3166-1 standard`_.

For consistency with established conventions in the modelling community, several country
names are shortened compared to ISO 3166-1, e.g. from "Bolivia, Plurinational State of"
to "Bolivia". See the full list of changes on GitHub_.

Also, "Kosovo" is added (with *alpha_3* code "KOS", following the
`IOC <https://olympics.com/ioc/kosovo>`_), even though it is not a universally
recognized state and not oficially included in ISO 3166-1.

You can access the list of countries via the model-registration `Excel template`_
or via the Python API.

The :py:mod:`nomenclature` package also provides utility functions to work with the
country-names and easily translate between country names and alpha-3/alpha-2 codes
(also known as ISO3 and ISO2 codes). Here is an example:

.. code:: python

  from nomenclature import countries

  # list of country names
  countries.names

  # mappings between alpha_3 (ISO3), alpha_2 and country names
  name = countries.get(alpha_3="...").name
  alpha_3 = countries.get(name="...").alpha_3
  alpha_2 = countries.get(name="...").alpha_2
