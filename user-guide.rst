Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

.. rubric:: Why are there different Scenario Explorer for specific projects?

Each project usually brings together different consortium partners and uses a
project-specific list of variable and regions (see :ref:`project-templates`).

It is therefore easier to keep projects separate, with its own database **platform**,
*Scenario Explorer* instance and related GitHub repository (see :ref:`scenario-processing`).

.. rubric:: What is the level of spatial granularity?

The spatial granularity of the data depends on the scope of the project and the
contributing modeling teams. The IAMC data format supports both aggregated data as well
as more detailed regional data like country-level resolution (see :ref:`countries`)
or the :ref:`nuts` used by the European Union.

.. rubric:: Which sectors are covered by the variable template?

The :ref:`variables` are flexible and can be adapted to the needs of the project.
