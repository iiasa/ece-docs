Scenario databases hosted by IIASA
==================================

The *Energy, Climate and Environment* program (ECE) at IIASA is hosting many databases
for the community to facilitate scenario analysis, model comparison and dissemination.

Model registration
------------------

To participate in a model comparison project using the IIASA scenario database infrastructure,
you have to "register" your model. A model registration requires three specifications:

* A model name including a *version number*, preferably using
  `semantic versioning <https://semver.org>`_
* A list or mapping of region names as they will be submitted (uploaded) to an IIASA
  database instance by the modeling team, and how the region names should appear
  in the processed scenario data
* A model mapping to perform region aggregation from *native_regions* to
  *common_regions* and renaming of model native regions (optional)

Option 1) Registration using an Excel template
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you do not feel comfortable using GitHub, please use the `Excel template`_ and send
it to the project managers by email.

Option 2) Registration using a GitHub pull request
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The preferred approach for model registration is starting a GitHub pull request.
Please contact the administrators if permissions for the project repository
are required.

Please follow the `Model registration user guide
<https://nomenclature-iamc.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_guide/model-registration.html>`_.
