Scenario databases hosted by IIASA
==================================

The *Energy, Climate and Environment* program (ECE) at IIASA is hosting many databases
for the community to facilitate scenario analysis, model comparison and dissemination.

Model registration
------------------

To participate in a model comparison project using the IIASA scenario database infrastructure,
you have to "register" your model. Model registration requires three specifications:

* A model name including a *version number*, preferably using
  `semantic versioning <https://semver.org>`_
* | A list of region names as they should appear in the processed scenario data
  | (e.g., after processing when sdatabase *Scenario Explorer* instance)
* A model mapping to perform region aggregation from *native_regions* to
  *common_regions* and renaming of model native regions (optional)

Please follow the `Model registration user guide
<https://nomenclature-iamc.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_guide/model-registration.html>`_.
